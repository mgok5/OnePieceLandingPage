                    <h2>Most Famous Pirate Crews</h2>
                    <div class="crew-title">
                        <h3 id="1">1-The Red Hair Pirates</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>The thing about this top-ranked pirate crew is that no one really knows how strong they are. The
                        Red Hair Pirates don`t show themselves too often, and when they do they usually get what they
                        want without fighting much. For example, when they showed up in the Marineford War, led by their
                        captain Shanks, the mere appearance of them on the battlefield was enough to basically stop the
                        fighting altogether.

                        According to Commodore Brannew, the Marine Officers who assign bounties to pirates, the Red Hair
                        crew <a href="https://gamerant.com/one-piece-highest-bounties-ranked/" target="_blank">has the
                            highest average bounty on the Grand Line.</a>has the highest average bounty on the Grand
                        Line. So, even if their numbers are more comparable to the Straw Hat main crew than the sheer
                        size of the Big Mom or Beasts Pirates, it seems like their fighting strength is still about
                        equal or higher to an Emperor`s army.</p>

                        The Beast Pirates are the crew readers/viewers are currently finding out about due to the Wano
                        Arc. They follow Kaido, <a href="https://gamerant.com/one-piece-kaido-devil-fruit-counters/"
                            target="_blank">the uncounterable invincible Emporer himself</a> (who seems to be a real
                        master of all forms of Haki), and there is truly a staggering amount of them.
                        Plus, because of Kaido`s effort to make the artificial Devil Fruits (called SMILE) with Caesar
                        Clown and Doflamingo, the majority of his crew has Zoan-type abilities as well. In fact, out of
                        all the pirates in the land, Kaido probably has the most DF users in his crew. So, that means
                        that this group of pirates has the power, numbers, prestige, and backing to take it all the way
                        to the end of the Grand Line.

                    <p>The Big Mom Pirates are both similar and different to Kaido`s in many ways. On one hand, it`s a
                        crew made up of thousands of strong members with a ton of DF users mixed in. But, Big Mom
                        considers her crew to be family while Kaido`s crew only welcomes strength.

                        Sure, Charlotte Linlin is a lot to handle, especially if she gets out of control, but the sheer
                        variety of powers and specialties her children have in the crew is what makes them so fearsome.

                    </div>
                    <p>Finally, we`re getting to the Four Emporers of the New World, with the most dastardly coming
                        first, that being The Blackbeard Pirates. Marshall D. Teach, the only wielder of two Devil
                        Fruits (one amazing Paramecia and <a
                            href="https://gamerant.com/one-piece-logia-type-devil-fruits-ranked/" target="_blank">one
                            unique Logia</a>), isn`t exactly a combat specialist. But, through his sheer strength, odd
                        body makeup, underhandedness, and double Devil Fruit powers, he`s managed to beat almost
                        everyone he`s come up against.

                        At the very least, the guy has always been absurdly strong in the Pirate Warrior spin-off games,
                        so that's something. Plus, because of his expertly timed attack on Impel Down, Blackbeard was
                        able to add some truly monstrous members to his crew before the timeskip that have only become
                        stronger after.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Even without the whole Straw Hat Grand Fleet aspect, The Straw Hat Pirates were always going to
                        be up there in the rankings. Monkey D. Luffy is basically the 5th New World Emporer at this
                        point, they've beaten almost everyone they've ever gone up against, and they're very
                        well-rounded.

                        There are no weak members of the Straw Hats, especially after the Time Skip. Nami learned a ton
                        of new tricks with her Clima-Tact, Usopp got buff and studied how to use the Pop Greens, and
                        even Chopper managed to train his odd DF into something powerful enough for the New World. Plus,
                        both the Dressrosa and Whole Cake Island arcs proved their strength is real in numerous ways,
                        including some insanely long battles that rivaled even Dragon Ball Z. It’s pretty clear that the
                        Straw Hats have truly become legendary in their status, strength, and partying potential
                        (especially when it comes to eating). Still, they're a very small crew compared to all the rest
                        of the big names in the New World.

                    <p>
                        The Golden Lion Pirates are canon, considering that Shiki is an actual character in the mainline
                        story. They come from the film One Piece: Strong World, one of the better OP films, as it turns
                        out. In any case, this is a crew led by the Golden Lion Shiki, the man who fought with Gol D.
                        Roger multiple times (and lost). Shiki has the Float-Float Devil Fruit, a Paramecia-type ability
                        that is much more powerful than it first appears.

                        And, because of this power, his crew gets to travel in style on their flying pirate ship. Now,
                        the Shiki crew (in their prime) had numbers that rivaled the entire naval force...nowadays they
                        have a ton of mutant monsters and a few key crew members. Still, this is the man who was the
                        first ever to escape from Impel Down, was a member of the Rocks Pirates, and had an ongoing
                        rivalry with Roger. So, of course, his crew is still one of the strongest around.

                    <p>
                        People for some reason seem to forget this, but The Kuja Pirates have always been insanely
                        strong. For one, they`re led by Boa Hancock, former Warlord of the Sea, who`s basically
                        unstoppable with the Love-Love Fruit thanks to her unmatched beauty.

                        Two, Boa's second-in-command are her two sisters, both of whom are giant women (but not Giants)
                        who ate Snake-type Zoan Devil Fruits and can use Haki. Three, the bulk of the crew is made up of
                        warriors from Amazon Lily, most if not all of which can use Haki as well. And, lastly, they have
                        a ship that can cross the Calm Belt, which is a rare thing for a pirate to have.

                    <p>
                        Here`s the thing, out of all the pirate crews introduced in the Worst Generation, The Kid
                        Pirates (outside of the Straw Hats) are probably the strongest on average from crewmate to
                        crewmate. For example, Trafalgar Law is insanely strong on his own, but the rest of the Heart
                        Pirates doesn`t seem to be nearly on the same level (sorry Bepo).

                        Meanwhile, The Kid Pirates have Eustass Kid and Killer as their two front liners, two people who
                        are relatively comparable to Luffy and Zoro. It's unclear how strong the rest of the members of
                        his crew are, such as the men known as Heat and Wire, but there aren't many of them, so they
                        must all be at the very least capable. Remember, this crew has gone up against Shanks, Big Mom,
                        and Kaido and lived to tell the tale.

                        crew, weapons, and treasure inside his very own body which is literally a fortress. This,
                        combined with the sheer number of crew members he has, his willingness to do anything to win,
                        and their villainous nature, makes them one of the most fearsome crews out there. Think about
                        it, this one man might be hiding hundreds of pirates inside his very own belly at any moment.

                    <p>
                        Luffy managed to beat Gecko Moria pretty early on in the story, but the guy and his crew are
                        still pretty powerful. Before Moria decided to leave everything to his subordinates, he was a
                        pretty good fighter in his own right, even managing to make it to Kaido's domain rather quickly.
                        Sadly, Kaido and his crew defeated the Gecko Pirates with relative ease, and most of Moria`s
                        crew was killed in the process.

                        This completely changed Moria`s outlook on life, deciding to make a new crew of zombies he
                        controlled rather than humans he trusted, which became The Thriller Bark Pirates. Moria has the
                        largest pirate ship in existence, can "make" a new crew in almost no time flat, and has the
                        power of a very strong Devil Fruit on his side. Sadly, Absalom is no longer with him, but with
                        Perona running back to his side, and Hogback making him an endless supply of Zombies (called
                        "Marios"), Gecko Moria usually has a pretty fearsome crew at his side. Currently, this crew
                        doesn't seem very strong, which is why it's so low on the list, but given enough time it could
                        easily ascend the ranks.

                    <p>
                        In the world of One Piece, the Giants have always been a mysterious race of warriors known for
                        their absurd natural battle prowess. In fact, the legend of Dorry and Broggy, the two captains
                        of the Giant Warrior Pirates, has been elaborated on more and more ever since their initial
                        appearance at Little Garden. And, for numerous reasons.

                        Now, The New Giant Warrior Pirates are a crew made up entirely of Giants and are a spiritual
                        revival of the Giant Warrior Pirates that were previously mentioned. There are only five of them
                        so far, led by Hajrudin. But, just like Luffy`s crew, each one is likely able to handle hundreds
                        of normal fighters on their own. Lastly, like most of the notable pirate crews not associated
                        with the Four Emperors, they are also part of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.

                    <p>
                        If this list was made before the time, the crew of Buggy the Clown wouldn`t be anywhere near it,
                        since they were one of the weakest pirate groups that Luffy encountered early on in his
                        adventures. Sure, Buggy`s Chop-Chop DF is pretty useful, but his combat ability and overall
                        cowardice lead him to avoid most fights he isn`t absolutely sure he can win. That said, after
                        the events of Impel Down, the Marineford War, and the timeskip, Buggy the Clown has lucked his
                        way into building up an organization all his own called Buggy's Delivery.

                        Before the Seven Warlords system was disbanded, Buggy was able to operate this Pirate Mercenary
                        service while sanctioned by the Marines. And, this rather large collaboration between pirates
                        includes criminals from all levels of Impel Down, Devil Fruit users like Alvida and Mr. 3, and
                        (for a time) included some Giants as well. It`s not a crew made up of big-name pirates, but
                        there are thousands of them. And, they all swear by Buggy`s leadership, which makes sense, given
                        the popularity Buggy somehow manages to hold on to.

                    <p>
                        The Tontatta Pirates are yet another crew underneath Straw Hat Luffy, as there aren`t many crews
                        in the New World in general who isn`t “part” of the Four (now tentatively five) Emperors in some
                        way. The Tontatta Pirates are made up entirely of 200 dwarves from Dressrosa, under the command
                        of The "Warrior" Leo, wielder of the Sew-Sew Devil Fruit.

                        The thing is, each of these tiny creatures has strength far surpassing that of an average man,
                        being able to wreck entire buildings singlehandedly in an instant. Plus, they`re absurdly fast,
                        innately stealthy, and overall very capable warriors. And, outside of Leo, this crew has two
                        other Devil Fruit users as well. Honestly, if these dwarves weren't so hopelessly trusting, they
                        could easily become one of the most fearsome crews in the New World (outside of the Four
                        Emperors).

                        Quite frankly, a lot of the villains in One Piece movies aren`t fellow pirates, but rather
                        people that are not part of any organization or marines. Yet, The Treasure Pirates, the crew
                        that function as the antagonists of the Heart of Gold special that would later tie into the plot
                        of One Piece, Film: Gold, are an exception.

                        Most of the crew is about as forgettable as many of the pirate crews in One Piece, but Captain
                        Mad Treasure, as well as his two trusted companions Psycho P and Naomi Drunk, are all pretty
                        powerful. They were able to put up pretty decent fights against Zoro, Sanji, and Luffy.

                        They`re near the bottom of this ranking in terms of strength, and the last time viewers saw them
                        they were still stuck inside a giant Sea King angler fish, but they are still assumedly active

                        Outside of Orlumbus himself, who was strong enough to fair pretty well in the Dressrosa
                        Coliseum, not much is known about the strength of his crew. But the sheer number of them and the
                        fact that they`ve survived in the New World implies this is a much different situation than Don
                        Krieg`s crew, which had numbers but almost no "real" strength.
